Crypster 1.0 is a local data encryption training program. The functionality of use is limited to 4 f-s
- BASE encoding / decoding
- XOR Encryption
- Vigenere Code
In the case of XOR encryption. In the name of avoiding key loss with the Vigenere cipher, the key is automatically attached to the cipher.
Encoding \ Decoding Base is performed using the BASE 64 system due to its relevance.
